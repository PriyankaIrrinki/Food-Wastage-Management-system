The severe gradual increase in food waste can be seen in recent years. According to WHO twenty percentage of people in all over population struggling for food. This project is used to manage the excess food in a useful way. 
The basic concept of this project is to collect the excess/left over food from donors such as restaurants, marriage halls, hostels etc and distribute to the needy people. This system comprises of two major modules such as donor, volunteers/required people. Donor will login through the web page and he/she can enter the food quantity details and address as a user (creating a new user or logging into existing user). Directly the details will get populated on the home page of website so that the required person can contact directly. Finally, volunteers can distribute the food this can reduce the food wastage.
Our project is potentially useful social innovation that tackles food waste and food poverty. The user details are maintained confidential, as it maintains a separate account for each user.
